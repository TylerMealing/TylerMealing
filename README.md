# Network Engineering Student

## About Me

I am a second-year Computer Systems and Network Engineering student at Southampton Solent University, currently pursuing my CCNA certification. In my first year, I gained practical experience in areas like user management, server resiliency, and penetration testing. Now in my second year, I'm working on containerised network automation solutions and a training package for network infrastructure upgrades. My skills include effective communication, extracting pertinent information for IT solutions, and expertise in cybersecurity trends. I also serve as a Student Ambassador at Solent University. Beyond academics, my passion lies in technology and gaming, where I have achieved speedrunning world records in Destiny 2. Despite facing challenges, my commitment to technology and personal growth remains unwavering.


I am currently honing my skills through coursework, practical labs, and real-world projects to become a skilled network engineer.
